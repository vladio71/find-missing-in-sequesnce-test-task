## Linear Algorithm
- O(n)
- This is a simple iteration through the array with a check for missing values.

## Binary Algorithm
- O(logN)
- Description:
    - The algorithm performs two sequential binary searches.

    - The first search is based on the idea that for any element in the array arr[i], the difference arr[i] - (i + 1) should be 0. If this difference is greater than 0, it indicates a missing number.

    - In the second search, the value found in the first search is used to correct the expected value, which allows the algorithm to find the second missing number.
